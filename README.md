## 📄 Terms

I, the developer, do not take any responsibility for any sort of misuse of this software. The ethical use of this toolset is highly recommended.

ALWAYS KEEP THIS IN MIND:

- STEP 1: Ethics are key for your personal development;
- STEP 2: A skilled professional does not need to transgress other people's privacy or impact the functioning of software that is not their own;
- STEP 3: Don't touch what is not yours;
- FINAL STEP: Read step one;

If you don't know what you're doing, how the hell can you be real? ⭐
